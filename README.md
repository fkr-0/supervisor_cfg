# Supervisor_cfg

This mini lib extends the supervisor xml-rpc lib with functions that allow
persistent manipulation of host-config files.

Although working and providing the planned features, the test coverage is 0% and thus the reader is expected to review the code him/herself for now.

The repository is strongly inspired by https://github.com/mnaberez/supervisor_twiddler.
